# Python_Computationally_efficient_version_of_the_R_estimator
This repository contains a computationally efficient (beta) version of the Matlab code that implements the R-estimator of shape matrices for CES distributed observations. The relevant theory is described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02239, while the proofs related to the computationally efficient version of the R-estimator can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10671.
